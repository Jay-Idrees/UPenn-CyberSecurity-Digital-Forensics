# Network Forensics


  - Forensic backups (system image or bit-level backups)  create an exact replica of all contents contained on the entire hard drive, including slack space, free space, and deleted files.
 
   - Forensic backup images are created in the following formats: 
  
     - **Raw formats:** These formats can be created with programs such as `dd`, `ddfldd`, and `ddcdd`.
       - .bin
       - .dd
       - .img
       - .raw
 
     - **Advanced Forensic Format (AFF):** The AFF format is for disk images and related forensic metadata.
       - .AFF
       - .AFF4

- One concern with working with live systems is that the data can get lost if there is powerloss and there is always a risk that there is a hacker who maybe trying to get into the system, waiting for someone to logback in

  - A **write blocker** is a device that allows anything connected to it to perform only read operations, therefore preventing the drive from being written to and overwriting  evidence.
